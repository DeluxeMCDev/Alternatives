# Alternatives

While DeluxeMC is a modern solution for Anarchy Servers, it might not align with your preferences as we utilize the Folia Software, which isn't always stable. If you're looking for another modern, open-source option for anarchy servers, I highly recommend checking out [Kaboom](https://kaboom.pw/). Their GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/kaboomserver).

Kaboom is originally a Free OP Anarchy server. However, by extensively modifying the "extras" plugin available on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/kaboomserver/extras), you can configure it to withhold OP privileges from players, making it a customizable alternative.
